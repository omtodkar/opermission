**oPermission** is android library to reduce the developer's efforts implementing android run-time permissions boilerplate. It is very simple to implement. With **oPermissions** it is not necessary to check for API or Build version requesting permissions. oPermissions have an **AutoExecute** mode, if application is running on API < 23 **oPermission** will automatically execute respective `@GrantedPermission` or `OPermission` with `true` annotated method(s). Library also supports MVP, MVVM, MVC, etc. architectural patterns.

##Usage

Single line code for request.

```java
RequestPermission.on(this).with(PermBean.create(Permission.READ_PHONE_STATE)).request();
```

Single method to get results.

```java
@OPermission(value = Permission.READ_PHONE_STATE)
void onReadPhoneStatePermission(@Result boolean isGranted) {
    if (isGranted) {
        textView.setText("Write Storage Granted");
    } else {
        textView.setText("Write Storage Denied");
    }
}
```
    
If your application is running on API lower than Marshmallows, result method works as permission is granted and value assigned to `isGranted` is true.
